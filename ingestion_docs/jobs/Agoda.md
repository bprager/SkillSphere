# Development Manager
**Agoda**
Bangkok, Thailand | September 2016 – January 2018

## Summary
Built and led multiple high-performance front-end teams for Agoda’s global travel platform, championing a data-driven culture of large-scale A/B testing (≤ 600 concurrent experiments) and multi-datacenter Kafka streaming to serve millions of travellers nightly. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Responsibilities
- Recruited, interviewed, and onboarded worldwide engineering talent—conducted 100 + remote Skype interviews in eight months.
- Architected JavaScript logging SDK to stream browser metrics to Kafka, enabling real-time user-journey analytics.
- Defined MVPs for “Travel Experience” and content-management products; drove backlog grooming and sprint planning as Scrum Master.
- Instituted graceful-degradation patterns and mobile data-compression algorithms to optimise performance on low-bandwidth networks.
- Evangelised “metrics-first” decision-making; embedded KPI dashboards (Incremental Bookings/Day) into team rituals.
- Collaborated with data-platform group to extend multi-DC Kafka topology for petabyte-scale clickstream ingestion. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Authored enterprise FE standards and introduced SonarQube static-analysis gates to .NET/TypeScript repos.

## Achievements
- **Scaled A/B testing framework to 600 simultaneous experiments**, cutting feature roll-out time by 50 % while preserving booking conversion. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Launched remote-logging pipeline that reduced client-side error triage time from days to minutes.
- Deployed mobile compression library (gzip+delta) lowering payload size by 35 % and boosting page speed (P75) by 400 ms on 3G.
- Grew three geo-distributed squads to > 30 engineers; team NPS rose from 46 to 72 within 12 months.

## Significant Project
### Agoda.com Front-End Evolution
- Migration from legacy WebForms to component-based React/.NET Core hybrid.
- Kafka-backed analytics, auto-rollback release automation, and feature-flag orchestration for experimentation at scale.

## Skills
- Technical team building & global hiring
- Product discovery & MVP definition
- High-volume A/B experimentation & metrics analytics
- Front-end performance engineering & resiliency patterns
- Agile leadership (Scrum, XP) & KPI management

## Technologies
- **Languages / Stacks**: .NET (C#), TypeScript, React, Webpack
- **Streaming / Data**: Apache Kafka (multi-DC), ClickHouse, Redshift
- **DevOps / Quality**: SonarQube, Git, Jenkins, Grafana, New Relic
- **Experimentation**: In-house A/B framework, StatsD, feature flags
- **Mobile Optimisation**: Service Workers, Brotli/gzip, custom diff-patch compression

## Lessons Learned
- Data-driven culture thrives when experiment velocity and observability are frictionless.
- Graceful degradation and payload compression are essential for emerging-market mobile traffic.
- Diverse, multi-cultural teams excel with clear KPI ownership and continuous feedback loops.
