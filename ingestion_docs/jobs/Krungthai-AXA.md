# Enterprise & Data Architect
**Krungthai-AXA Life Insurance PCL**
Bangkok, Thailand | August 2019 – September 2020

## Summary
Led regional architecture governance and cloud-data strategy for a top Thai life-insurance joint venture, delivering an AWS-based data lake, an automated underwriting platform, and COVID-accelerated telehealth solutions while ensuring IFRS 17 and FATCA compliance.

## Responsibilities
- Chaired the **Regional Architecture Council**, approving all major solution designs across Bangkok and Hong Kong operations.
- Defined application & data-rationalisation roadmap; prioritised decommission or cloud migration of 40+ legacy apps.
- Designed and oversaw build of an **AWS data lake** (Glue, S3, Redshift) to consolidate policy, claims, and actuarial data.
- Served as chief architect for **AUWrite** automatic underwriting system—integrated 10+ external data sources (criminal, medical, payments).
- Drove cloud-native reference patterns on OpenShift, Kong API gateway, and Keycloak IAM; issued reusable ADRs.
- Coordinated with AXA Europe to align Salesforce CRM and IFRS 17 reporting standards.
- Ran vendor selection for BPMN tooling and conducted organisation-wide data-maturity assessment (DAMA lens).
- Maintained business-continuity architecture throughout COVID-19; expedited rollout of TeleHealth mobile app.

## Achievements
- **Delivered AUWrite underwriting platform**, cutting manual review time by 70 % and raising straight-through-processing to 85 %.
- Built production data lake ingesting 500 GB/day; enabled first AI/ML risk-scoring PoCs.
- Launched **TeleHealth** within 90 days; supported 12 k virtual consults in first quarter of 2020.
- Ensured on-schedule compliance with **IFRS 17** and **FATCA** via canonical data models and automated lineage tracking.
- Achieved zero downtime during Thailand’s strict COVID-19 lockdown through fail-over architecture and remote-ops runbooks.

## Significant Projects
### AUWrite – Automatic Underwriting System
- Microservice stack on OpenShift; rule engine + ML risk model; real-time integrations (Kong, Redis) with external data providers.

### TeleHealth Mobile Platform
- Flutter front-end; Kubernetes back-end; secure video via WebRTC; integrated e-pharmacy ordering and payment gateway.

## Skills
- Enterprise & data architecture (TOGAF, DAMA)
- Cloud migration & data-lake design (AWS)
- Regulatory compliance (IFRS 17, FATCA, Thai PDPA)
- Architecture governance & council leadership
- Legacy rationalisation & vendor selection
- Rapid product acceleration under crisis conditions

## Technologies
- **Cloud / Data**: AWS (Glue, S3, Redshift, IAM), OpenShift
- **Integration**: Kong API Gateway, Keycloak IAM, Redis, AS/400 adapters
- **DevOps / Observability**: Dynatrace, Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Languages / Frameworks**: Java, Python, BPMN tools
- **Security & Privacy**: Thai PDPA controls, OAuth 2.0, JWT

## Lessons Learned
- Thai **PDPA** imposes stricter consent and localisation rules than GDPR—early legal alignment is critical.
- Architecture councils accelerate decision-making when backed by clear reference models and ADRs.
- Crisis-driven products (e.g., telehealth) succeed when built on pre-established cloud & security patterns.
