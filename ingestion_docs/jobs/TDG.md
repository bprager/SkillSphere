# Senior Technical Architect
**The Digital Group**
Princeton, NJ | December 2002 – December 2003

## Summary
Delivered a year-long SOA strategy engagement for Wolters Kluwer’s U.S. operations, crafting the enterprise integration roadmap, .NET reference stack, and phased rollout plan that later underpinned the firm’s architecture-review practice.

## Responsibilities
- Led discovery workshops in Deerfield, OH to capture cross-division integration pain points and future-state business capabilities.
- Authored **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) blueprint**—domain models, service contracts, canonical message schema, and governance process.
- Evaluated Microsoft .NET vs. J2EE platforms; recommended .NET based on existing C#/SQL Server talent and licensing economics.
- Defined architecture-review board charter and review checklists that later evolved into Wolters Kluwer’s TAR/PRR process.  [oai_citation:2‡ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236683146_Architecture_and_Production_Readiness_Reviews_in_Practice?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Mentored Wolters Kluwer architects on SOA design patterns (ESB, façade, service registry) and WSDL/XSD authoring.
- Presented cost-benefit analysis and phased budget to CIO and senior VP of technology.

## Significant Project
### Wolters Kluwer SOA Strategy & Pilot
- Built POC on Microsoft .NET Remoting/Web Services; demonstrated 2× performance vs. legacy batch FTP exchanges.

## Skills
- Enterprise & solution architecture (SOA)
- Stakeholder facilitation & roadmap development
- Technology evaluation & cost modelling
- Architecture governance & review frameworks
- Technical mentorship & knowledge transfer

## Technologies
- **Platform**: Microsoft .NET 1.1, ASP.NET, IIS 6.0
- **Integration**: WSDL, XML/XSD, SOAP over HTTP
- **Data**: SQL Server 2000, DTS packages
- **Tools**: Visio UML

## Lessons Learned
- Early investment in governance (review boards, canonical models) prevents service sprawl later in an SOA journey.
- Aligning platform choice with in-house skill sets accelerates adoption and reduces outsourcing costs.
- Incremental, pilot-driven rollouts build credibility and executive confidence in large architecture transformations.
- Confirmed that technology transformations succeed only when governance, data stewardship, and change-management readiness are in place; recommended a phased approach, after which the client postponed rollout until prerequisites were met.
