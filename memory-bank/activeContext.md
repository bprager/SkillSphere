# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Certification template system implementation
- Individual file processing optimization
- Documentation updates for recent changes
- Hypergraph processing improvements

## Recent Changes

- **Certification Data Structure Migration**: Split monolithic `certifications.md` into 8 individual files
- **Template System Creation**: Comprehensive certification template with YAML front matter
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated CHANGELOG.md and architecture.md with certification changes
- **Processing Optimization**: Individual file processing for better hypergraph accuracy
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Added entity IDs, status tracking, and competency arrays

## Active Decisions

1. Individual file processing for optimal hypergraph accuracy
2. YAML front matter standardization for consistent metadata
3. Template system for future certification consistency
4. Enhanced documentation for system changes

## Next Steps

1. Monitor hypergraph processing performance with new structure
2. Validate template system usage
3. Consider applying similar patterns to other data types
4. Review and update related documentation

## Current Considerations

- Template system effectiveness
- Hypergraph processing efficiency
- Documentation completeness
- Data structure consistency

## Open Questions

1. Should we apply similar template patterns to other data types?
2. How to optimize hypergraph processing further?
3. Are there additional metadata fields needed?
4. What other documentation needs updating?
