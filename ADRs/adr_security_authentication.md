# ADR: Security and Authentication Approach

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The SkillSphere MCP Server requires secure access control to protect sensitive career data and ensure only authorized clients can perform operations.

## Decision
- Replace Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication with OAuth 2 Resource Server using token introspection.
- Enforce OAuth 2 Bearer JWT validation on all protected endpoints.
- Use environment variables to configure OAuth introspection endpoint, client ID, and resource ID.
- Provide a feature flag (ENABLE_OAUTH) to toggle between PAT and OAuth for smooth migration.
- Use FastAPI dependency injection to validate access tokens.
- Log authentication events and failures for audit and monitoring.
- Ensure consistent error responses for unauthorized and invalid tokens.

## Consequences
- Improved security with industry-standard OAuth 2.
- Easier integration with identity providers like Keycloak or Auth0.
- Flexibility to revert to PAT if needed during migration.
- Clear audit trail of authentication events.

## Next Steps
- Complete OAuth integration and testing.
- Update client applications to use OAuth tokens.
- Monitor authentication logs and metrics.
