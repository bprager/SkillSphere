# ADR: Logging Strategy for SkillSphere MCP Server

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The SkillSphere MCP Server requires a robust logging strategy to enable effective monitoring, troubleshooting, and observability. Logs will be collected and visualized using Loki and Grafana, integrated with OpenTelemetry tracing.

## Decision
Adopt a structured logging approach with the following guidelines:

- **Log Levels:**
  - **INFO:** Major lifecycle events (startup, shutdown), successful key operations, configuration loading.
  - **WARNING:** Recoverable issues, unexpected but non-fatal conditions.
  - **ERROR:** Failures, exceptions, and critical errors that impact functionality.

- **Log Format:**
  - Use structured JSON logs to facilitate parsing and querying in Loki.
  - Include contextual metadata such as timestamp, log level, module, function, and request identifiers.

- **Integration:**
  - Correlate logs with OpenTelemetry traces using trace IDs.
  - Ensure logs from middleware, API routes, database access, and tool handlers include relevant context.

- **Performance:**
  - Avoid excessive logging to prevent log flooding.
  - Use appropriate log levels to balance detail and noise.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Log exceptions with stack traces.
  - Provide clear, actionable messages in logs.

## Consequences
- Improved observability and faster troubleshooting.
- Consistent log data for dashboards and alerts.
- Minimal performance impact due to controlled logging.

## Next Steps
- Implement logging configuration in the application.
- Add log statements in key modules following the guidelines.
- Update documentation to reflect the logging strategy.
