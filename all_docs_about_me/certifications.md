  certifications.md  ¬∑  Maintainer: Bernd Prager
  PURPOSE
    ‚Ä¢ Master list of *all* certifications (earned, expired, in-progress, planned).
    ‚Ä¢ Serves as single data-source for r√©sum√© builders, LinkedIn updaters,
      or other AI-driven export pipelines.

  IMPORTANT ‚Äî AI / AUTOMATION GUIDANCE
    1. When generating any *external* document (CV, client profile, website):
         ‚Ä¢ Export **only** the certifications under **## Professional Certifications**.
         ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúIn-progress / planned‚Äù items may be exported **only** if clearly
           labelled ‚Äú(In Progress, ETA YYYY-MM)‚Äù ‚Äî they must never be shown as
           completed.
    2. Items in **## ‚ÜóÔ∏é Certifications In Progress / Planned** are internal and
       MUST NOT be shown as earned credentials unless rule 1 is followed.
    3. Preserve ISO-8601 dates; downstream scripts parse them.
    4. Retain all Markdown links so PDFs / badge URLs stay resolvable.
    5. Do not alter the heading hierarchy; parsers rely on the ## / ### levels.

  HOUSE RULES
    ‚Ä¢ Newest first within each section.
    ‚Ä¢ Keep verbose notes inside <details> blocks.
    ‚Ä¢ Store local artifacts in ./certs/  (git-tracked or git-lfs as appropriate).
