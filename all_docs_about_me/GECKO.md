# Founder & CEO
**GECKO Gesellschaft für Computer- und Kommunikationssysteme mbH**
Rostock, Germany | April 1990 – December 1999

## Summary
Founded and scaled one of the first private software-engineering firms in post-reunification Rostock, driving it from a single-person start-up to a 30-employee organisation with seven-figure annual revenue while pioneering German web-search R & D and municipal IT solutions.

## Responsibilities
- Incorporated GECKO mbH, established legal, financial, and operational structures, and secured initial seed capital.
- Defined company strategy, portfolio (custom software, IT services, early Internet/WWW solutions) and go-to-market plans.
- Recruited and led cross-functional teams (software engineering, consulting, administration) growing to 30 staff by 2000.
- Oversaw architecture and delivery of enterprise software (rental-management, campus-information, data-integration).
- Negotiated and managed university collaborations and federal research grants (e.g., BMBF-funded **GETESS** project). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Directed sales & marketing, winning municipal and corporate clients in Germany, Belgium, and the UK.
- Supervised finance, budgeting, and annual audits ensuring sustainable cash-flow and profitability.

## Achievements
- **Scaled GECKO from start-up to recognised software provider with international client base and €1 M+ revenue.**
  - Achieved > 40 % CAGR during first five fiscal years.
  - Built long-term partnerships with Rostock city administration and German universities.
- **Co-initiated GETESS (“German Text Exploitation and Search System”)**—a three-year BMBF project with AIFB-Karlsruhe, DFKI, and Uni Rostock; delivered a semantic web-search prototype and multilingual indexing engine. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Moved headquarters to Koch-Gotha-Str. 1, 18055 Rostock and expanded infrastructure (leased 2 Mbit Internet uplink—rare in early-1990s East Germany).

## Significant Projects
### Municipal Rental-Management System
End-to-end property-rental workflow for Rostock city housing department: contract lifecycle, tenant ledger, and reporting.
- Oracle DB backend, client-server GUIs, nightly batch billing.
- Enabled 30 % processing-time reduction for ≈20 000 rental units.

### GETESS – Searching the Web Exploiting German Texts
Consortium R & D project (1997–2000) to build a domain-independent, linguistically enriched search engine.
- Designed crawler pipeline, SGML text normaliser, and semantic index store.
- Deployed public prototype at **getess.gecko.de** (2000). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## AI & Machine-Learning Contributions
- **AI Scope** Led GECKO’s work-package for an ontology-driven semantic Web search engine (GETESS), focusing on German natural-language content and early Semantic-Web principles. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Techniques / Models** Implemented ontology-based information-extraction rules, morphological parsing, concept-vector indexing, and ontology-based clustering; evaluated early inference engine **SILRI** for semantic ranking. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- **Datasets & Tooling** Crawled ≈ 2 M German web pages; engineered SGML→RDF conversion pipeline; hosted shared Oracle-backed knowledge warehouse accessible over leased-line Frame Relay to DFKI/Karlsruhe.
- **Impact Metrics** Consortium tests reported ~30 % precision gain over keyword search in the tourism domain and demonstrated multilingual abstract generation—results cited in CIA-99 and SEAL-II follow-up projects. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- **Leadership & Collaboration** Represented the SME partner, coordinated four institutions, supervised five engineers, co-authored **“GETESS — Searching the Web Exploiting German Texts”** (CIA-99), and presented live demos at CeBIT 1999.
- **Continuous Learning** Completed NLP & ontology-engineering workshops at AIFB-Karlsruhe, became early W3C RDF adopter, and self-studied information-retrieval literature to guide prototype evaluation.

## Skills
