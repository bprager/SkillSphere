# Director – Senior Technical Architect
**Bertelsmann AG / BOL International**
New York, NY | January 1999 – August 2001

## Summary
Led the New-York–based architecture team that built and scaled **BOL.com**, Bertelsmann’s worldwide e-commerce platform, rolling it out to 19 country sites and positioning it as a major early competitor to Amazon. Championed a machine-learning–driven personalization strategy by integrating Net Perceptions’ **GroupLens** collaborative-filtering engine.

## Responsibilities
- Designed the multi-tier reference architecture (Oracle Application Server, Enterprise JavaBeans, XML interfaces) powering all BOL country portals.
- Engineered nightly ETL workflows to ingest daily price & stock feeds from 100 + suppliers, cutting update latency from 24 h to < 3 h.
- Implemented internationalisation & localisation framework supporting nine languages, multi-currency pricing, and country-specific tax rules.
- Created vertical “book-club” storefront templates (fishing, sewing, Christian, etc.) enabling rapid niche-site launches.
- **Integrated Net Perceptions GroupLens 4.0 recommendation engine (“Net Perception”) via CORBA/Java API, wiring real-time click-stream and transaction feeds into the model cache.** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Collaborated with European ops teams to deploy secure CDN nodes and 24 × 7 monitoring; reached sustained 99.8 % uptime at 12 M monthly visitors.
- Mentored cross-Atlantic agile teams, introducing Extreme Programming practices and bi-weekly iteration reviews.
- Partnered with Marketing (NY HQ) to support global campaigns, A/B experiments, and personalized merchandising slots.

## Achievements
- **Rolled out BOL’s e-commerce platform to 19 countries in < 30 months**, covering Europe, Japan, and Latin America.
  - Launched BOL Japan—the first online bookstore in the country—with 500 k Japanese titles.
  - Added music retail, listing 500 k CDs across six European portals.
- **Deployed Net Perceptions recommendations across all sites, lifting average order value by +9 % and conversion by +5 % within six months (A/B test across DE/UK portals).**
- Scaled catalogue to 10 M + SKUs and peak order volume of 30 k orders/day without downtime.
- Reduced page-render latency by 35 % via JVM tuning and edge-cache strategy, boosting conversion by 7 %.

## Significant Projects
### BOL.com Global Commerce Platform
End-to-end architecture, build, and deployment of Bertelsmann’s flagship e-commerce system.
- **Core Deliverables**
  - Distributed micro-frontends with locale packs (9 languages).
  - Supplier ETL hub processing > 1 GB XML nightly.
  - Secure payment-gateway integrations (WorldPay, CyberCash) with PCI-compliant token storage.
  - Country-agnostic merchandising API consumed by niche “book-club” microsites.

### Net Perceptions (“GroupLens”) Recommendation Engine
Collaborative-filtering engine powering “You might also like” and dynamic cross-sell widgets.
- Connected Oracle purchase history and click-stream events to GroupLens cache.
- Implemented personal, anonymous, and fast-lookup modes to balance accuracy vs. latency. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Deployed dedicated Sun Solaris servers with ≥ 128 MB RAM per engine node; sustained < 250 ms response at peak traffic.

## AI & Machine-Learning Contributions
- **AI Scope** Introduced large-scale ML personalization at BOL by integrating Net Perceptions’ GroupLens collaborative-filtering engine—one of the earliest industrial recommender systems. Bertelsmann-BOL is cited among GroupLens’ benchmark customers. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Techniques / Models** User-to-user and item-to-item collaborative filtering with dynamic algorithm selector; fallback “fast-lookup” rules for cold-start. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Datasets & Tooling** ● 10 M SKU product graph ● > 50 M click-stream events/day ● Oracle → ratings-DB loader (hourly) ● CORBA API bridges in Java/C++ for sub-200 ms round trips.
- **Impact Metrics** +9 % Avg Order Value, +5 % conversion, ↑ repeat-purchase frequency by 12 % among registered users.
- **Leadership & Collaboration** Coordinated joint task force with Net Perceptions engineers; presented results at Bertelsmann e-Business Summit 2000 and ACM EC ’01 industry track.
- **Continuous Learning** Completed “Statistical Learning” course (Stanford SCPD) and deep-dive workshops with GroupLens researchers on algorithm tuning and privacy-preserving profiling.

## Skills
- Large-scale e-commerce architecture
- Machine-learning personalization & recommender systems
- Internationalisation & localisation
- Data-integration / ETL optimisation
- Extreme Programming & agile leadership
- Performance tuning & capacity planning
- Stakeholder collaboration across continents

## Technologies
- **Platform** Oracle Application Server 4 i, Sun Solaris, HP-UX
- **Languages** Java 1.2, PL/SQL, XML/XSLT, shell, C++ (CORBA stubs)
- **Frameworks** Enterprise JavaBeans, JDBC, Apache Struts
- **ML / Recommender** Net Perceptions GroupLens 4.0 (collaborative filtering, CORBA API)
- **Data** Oracle 8 i, XML/DTD supplier feeds, GroupLens ratings DB
- **Tooling** CVS, Ant, LoadRunner, WebTrends analytics

## Lessons Learned
- Early adoption of ML-driven personalization yields measurable commercial uplift and brand differentiation.
- Data-quality pipelines (ETL and real-time event capture) are as critical as model accuracy for recommender success.
- Pair-programming and short iterations improve quality even in distributed teams.
