# Director Delivery Management / Enterprise Architect
**EPAM Systems, Inc.**
Los Angeles, CA | October 2020 – April 2025

## Summary
Led enterprise-architecture and large-scale delivery for marquee clients while becoming a key evangelist for EPAM’s *AI-first* strategy.
Co-authored the internal **FinOps POV for LLM cost-efficiency**, co-presented the public *“LLM Architecture Patterns”* session at **EPAM Learning Week 2023** (13 Dec 2023) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, and single-handedly built a knowledge-graph-RAG POC on DIAL™ :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
Guided presales teams, mentored 30 + solution architects, and embedded AI/RUN™ methodology :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} across global accounts.

## Responsibilities
- **GenAI Evangelism & Education** Ran weekly “AI Guild” clinics; designed hands-on labs for vector search, RAG and prompt-engineering; mentored > 30 architects.
- **FinOps for LLMs** Owned the internal POV quantifying GPU-/token-level cost drivers and optimisation levers; worked with Finance to embed KPIs in EPAM AI/RUN™ playbooks :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- **Thought Leadership** Co-speaker, *LLM Architecture Patterns* (Learning Week 2023); guest on EPAM AI-Native podcast series.
- **Presales Advisory** Shaped AI bids in insurance, retail, telco; created demo stacks (Azure OpenAI + knowledge-graph) that converted 4 new logos in 2024.
- **Engagement Leadership** Oversaw multi-cloud solution architecture (AWS, Azure) for media, healthcare and fintech clients; managed geo-distributed squads (50 + engineers).

## Achievements
- **FinOps POV adopted company-wide**, projecting 35 % LLM OPEX savings and informing DIAL™ pricing calculators.
- **Insurance Semantic-Search & KG-RAG POC** delivered in 6 weeks: 15 M pages PDF corpus → < 2 s semantic answers; demo shortlisted for client’s 2025 production roadmap.
- **Architect Mentoring** 90 % of mentees certified on Azure AI or AWS GenAI within 9 months; internal CSAT 4.7/5.
- **Public Advocacy** Learning Week talk drew 1 500 live viewers, rated 4.8/5; slides reused in EPAM’s external GenAI roadshows.

## Significant Projects
### Insurance Semantic Search & KG-RAG POC
Python / LlamaIndex backend with ReACT agents; Neo4j vector + ontology store; Vue 3 SPA front-end.
- Indexed 25 GB PDF contracts into hybrid vector + BM25 store.
- Multi-agent chain routed questions to **DIAL™** (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o) for extraction, summarisation and graph enrichment.
- Deployed on Azure Container Apps; end-to-end latency p95 = 1.9 s.

### EPAM FinOps POV for LLMs
White-paper + Excel model capturing GPU utilisation, context-window, quantisation and batch-size trade-offs.
- Benchmarks: GPT-4o vs. Mixtral 8x7b on A10 vs. A100 vs. CPU-only.
- Recommendations integrated into AI/RUN™ cost-tracker.

### LLM Architecture Patterns (Learning Week 2023)
1-hour public session comparing monolithic vs. modular LLM stacks, guard-rail strategies and RAG blueprints; co-presented with Jonathan Rioux & John Soares.
- Demoed LangChain Router + DIAL™ orchestration across public and private models.

## AI & Machine-Learning Contributions
- **Scope** Evangelised enterprise GenAI adoption; created reusable RAG templates, FinOps calculators and multi-agent orchestration patterns.
- **Techniques / Models** GPT-4o, DIAL-LLM, Mixtral, ReACT agents, LangGraph finite-state chains, vector-search hybrid ranking.
- **Datasets & Tooling** PDF → text pipeline (PyMuPDF), Neo4j vector indexes, Azure OpenAI embeddings, Grafana + Prometheus cost dashboards.
- **Impact Metrics** Projected 35 % token-cost reduction; POC answered 92 % of insurance FAQs with top-3 accuracy.
- **Leadership** Chaired EPAM **AI Guild**; mentored architects, authored internal playbooks; spoke at Learning Week and client webinars.

## Skills
- Generative-AI architecture (RAG, FinOps, multi-agent)
- Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure) governance
- Delivery management & performance analytics
- Knowledge-graph modelling (Neo4j, RDF)
- Technical evangelism & public speaking
- Vue 3 / Python full-stack prototyping

## Technologies
- **LLMs / GenAI** Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, DIAL™, Mixtral, OpenAI embeddings
- **Frameworks** LlamaIndex, LangChain, LangGraph, ReACT
- **Data / Graph** Neo4j, Azure Cognitive Search, Pandas, Grafana
- **Cloud** Azure Container Apps, Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, S3
- **DevOps** Terraform, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana Loki
- **Languages** Python, JavaScript / TypeScript (Vue 3), SQL, Bash

## Lessons Learned
- *FinOps must be baked into every GenAI design*—monitor GPU minutes, context tokens and retrieval accuracy together.
- Knowledge-graph–augmented RAG unlocks enterprise-grade fidelity, especially for large PDF corpora.
- Consistent evangelism and hands-on mentoring are catalysts for organisation-wide AI adoption.
