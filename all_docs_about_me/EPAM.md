## Responsibilities
- Architected and governed multi-cloud solutions (AWS, Azure) across media, healthcare, fintech and automotive portfolios.
- Served as **Local Solution Architecture Lead for GenAI initiatives**, coaching 30+ architects on RAG patterns, model evaluation and cost controls.
- Delivered technology strategy, PoCs and reference architectures for machine-learning, DevOps and WebRTC workloads.
- Directed delivery teams (50+ people across NA, LATAM, India, AUS) as engagement lead; tracked burndown, velocity and PR cycle-time with Python analytics.
- Provided presales GenAI advisory—built demos using Azure OpenAI GPT-4, LangGraph session memory and Neo4j knowledge graphs.
- Conducted >100 technical interviews (Java, C++, SQL, Python) and ran Amazon-style mock interviews to raise hiring bar.
- Acted as conference speaker and internal lecturer on GenAI cost-optimization and EPAM DIAL orchestration platform.  [oai_citation:2‡EPAM](https://www.epam.com/services/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Achievements
- **Designed EPAM’s first production Knowledge-Graph + RAG chat for First American Title**, integrating Azure OpenAI GPT-4, LangGraph memory and Neo4j vector search; demo reduced call-center handling time by 27 %.
- **Prototyped WebRTC video-conferencing on Vizio smart-TVs**, instrumented Linux boards, streamed metrics via AWS Lambda → Redshift, and visualised KPIs in Grafana (99th-pct latency <150 ms).
- **Bootstrapped “Compliance-as-a-Service” green-field build for Amazon Compliance**, forming three geo-distributed squads from zero to 50 engineers in six weeks; achieved sprint velocity >80 SP after three iterations.
- Authored **GenAI FinOps POV** adopted by EPAM’s AI/RUN™ practice, outlining GPU fleet utilisation and token-cost benchmarks that projected 35 % OPEX savings.  [oai_citation:3‡EPAM](https://www.epam.com/exploring-the-overlap-cost-optimization-and-digital-transformation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Significant Projects
### Vizio Smart-TV WebRTC Performance Lab
- Embedded C++ probes on Linux TV boards; AWS IoT & Lambda ETL; Grafana dashboards for codec jitter/latency.

### Amazon Compliance-as-a-Service Platform
- Micro-frontends (React), event-driven Java back-end on AWS (EKS, RDS); metrics analytics in Python/Pandas.

### First American GenAI Knowledge-Graph Chatbot
- LangChain → LangGraph pipeline; Neo4j vector index; Azure OpenAI GPT-4 orchestration; DIAL™ connectors.

## Skills
- Generative AI solution architecture (RAG, vector search, LLM cost-ops)
- Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure) architecture & governance
- Delivery management & metrics analytics
- WebRTC & real-time video performance engineering
- Technical interviewing & team bootstrapping
- Conference speaking & technical evangelism

## Technologies
- **LLMs / GenAI**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4, OpenAI embeddings, EPAM DIAL™, AI/RUN™    [oai_citation:5‡EPAM](https://www.epam.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/2023/epam-launches-dial-a-unified-generative-ai-orchestration-platform?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex
- **Data / Graph**: Neo4j, Amazon Redshift, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, EC2, RDS, ECS, EKS, S3, Redshift), Azure (OpenAI, Functions, Containers)
- **DevOps**: Terraform, GitHub Actions, Grafana, Prometheus
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C++, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript

## Lessons Learned
- FinOps for LLMs requires hybrid GPU/CPU utilisation tracking and prompt-token budgeting.
- Knowledge-Graph-augmented chat drastically improves answer fidelity for enterprise content.
- Early instrumentation and metrics drive performance gains in real-time media and distributed teams.
