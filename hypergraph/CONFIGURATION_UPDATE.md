# Hypergraph Ingestion Pipeline - Configuration Update

## Summary

Updated the hypergraph ingestion pipeline to process the new `ingestion_docs` directory structure and properly exclude README files from processing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Default Configuration

- **File**: `hypergraph/src/hypergraph/core/config.py`
- **Change**: Updated `doc_root` default from `"./docs"` to `"../ingestion_docs"`
- **Impact**: Pipeline now processes the correct directory structure by default

### 2. Added README File Filtering

- **File**: `hypergraph/src/hypergraph/__main__.py`
- **Change**: Added logic to skip files with name `README.MD` (case-insensitive)
- **Impact**: README files are now excluded from ingestion, preventing documentation from being processed as content

### 3. Updated Environment Configuration

- **Files**: `hypergraph/.env` and `hypergraph/.env.example`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed unused `OLLAMA_MODEL` variable that was causing configuration errors
  - Cleaned up `DOC_ROOT` path (removed extra space)
- **Impact**: Configuration now loads without errors

### 4. Added Test Coverage

- **File**: `hypergraph/tests/test_main.py`
- **Change**: Added `test_readme_files_are_skipped` test
- **Impact**: Ensures README filtering works correctly and prevents regressions

## Verification Results

### File Processing Analysis

- **Total markdown files**: 37
- **Content files (processed)**: 34
- **README files (skipped)**: 3

### README Files Excluded

- `ingestion_docs/README.md`
- `ingestion_docs/certs/README.md`
- `ingestion_docs/skills/README.md`

### Content Files Processed

All markdown files in the following directories:

- `ingestion_docs/jobs/` - Job experience records
- `ingestion_docs/certs/` - Certification documentation
- `ingestion_docs/extras/` - Additional context files
- `ingestion_docs/skills/` - Skill documentation (all categories)

### Test Coverage

- All existing tests pass
- New test validates README filtering
- Overall test coverage: 98%

## Configuration

The pipeline now uses the following default configuration:

```python
doc_root: str = "../ingestion_docs"
```

And can be overridden via environment variables:

```bash
DOC_ROOT=../ingestion_docs
```

## Usage

The pipeline will now automatically:

1. Process all `.md` files in the `ingestion_docs` directory structure
2. Skip any files named `README.md` (case-insensitive)
3. Extract triples from content files and build the knowledge graph
4. Generate Node2Vec embeddings for semantic search

## Impact

This update ensures that:

- ✅ All intended content files are processed
- ✅ Documentation files (README.md) are excluded
- ✅ The new skill documentation structure is fully supported
- ✅ Job experience, certifications, and extras are included
- ✅ Tests validate the filtering behavior
- ✅ Configuration is clean and error-free
