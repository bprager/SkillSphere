# Lead Technologist
**Viant Corporation**
New York, NY | February 2002 – November 2002

## Summary
Led an exclusive consulting engagement for Merck & Co., designing and delivering a Perl-driven translation pipeline that generated legally compliant pharmaceutical product information for multiple international markets.

## Responsibilities
- Facilitated requirements-gathering workshops with Merck regulatory, legal, and localization teams.
- Designed end-to-end translation workflow: ingestion, linguistic rules engine, approval routing, and multi-format output (PDF, XML, HTML).
- Implemented core text-processing modules in Perl, leveraging regular expressions and locale files to satisfy country-specific labeling laws.
- Built canonical XML schema for drug leaflets; automated validation against local regulatory templates.
- Established version-control (CVS) branching model and nightly build scripts for continuous QA.
- Coordinated user-acceptance testing with EU, LATAM, and APAC regulatory groups; captured change requests for rapid iteration.

## Achievements
- **Delivered first production release in 14 weeks**, reducing manual translation turnaround from 10 days to <48 hours.
- Achieved 100 % compliance in initial FDA and EMA submission audits—zero labeling defects.
- Cut localization costs by an estimated 40 % through reusable language rules and automated typesetting.

## Significant Project
### Global Product Information Translation System (GPITS)
- Modular Perl engine with plug-in rule sets per jurisdiction.
- XML master content repository synced to CVS; XSL-FO pipeline for printable leaflets.
- Integrated workflow notifications with Merck’s Lotus Notes for legal sign-off.

## Skills
- Regulatory & localization architecture
- Perl text-processing & scripting
- XML schema design & validation
- Stakeholder facilitation in highly regulated environments
- Continuous integration & release automation

## Technologies
- **Languages**: Perl 5, shell scripting
- **Data / Formats**: XML, XSL-FO, HTML, PDF
- **Version Control**: CVS
- **Platforms**: Solaris & Linux build hosts
- **Tools**: GNU gettext, Regular-expression libraries, Automated test harness in Perl/TAP

## Lessons Learned
- Regulatory localization demands rigorous change control and audit-ready artifacts.
- Canonical XML plus rule-based transformations deliver scalable multi-language outputs.
- Close collaboration between engineering and legal teams is essential for GxP-compliant software deliveries.
