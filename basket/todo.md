**Analyzing LinkedIn vs. Summary**

I’m comparing summary.md and linkedin\_profile.md to figure out if deleting the LinkedIn profile would result in losing key info. LinkedIn includes contact details, skills (like Ollama, PyTorch), languages (English, German), certifications, and publications. The experience section mirrors summary.md but in a condensed version. Meanwhile, the education section in summary.md lists Technical University Dresden but omits secondary education (Ostseegymnasium). If I delete LinkedIn, I’d need to capture sections like contact info, skills, and certifications elsewhere.

**Identifying Unique Info Between Files**

The information in LinkedIn and summary.md overlap in several areas, but there are some unique elements to capture. LinkedIn lists specific skills like Ollama, PyTorch, and SQLite, which aren’t in summary.md but should probably be added. It also specifies languages (English, German) and includes a publication (GETESS), which isn't listed explicitly elsewhere. The LinkedIn experience section breaks down roles at EPAM, highlighting IoT and compliance management, which might be missing or less detailed in summary.md.


**Reducing Redundancy**

The past job listed as 'FJB-40 Staff Sergeant 1978-1981' could be military service, which isn’t in the summary.md. It might need to be captured. Age of experience might be less relevant, though it's worth considering. The contact and website information are repeated in both files, but there’s a link to an external website (e.g., [www.zeromq.org](http://www.zeromq.org)) that could be unnecessary. Certificate details might overlap too. I’ll focus on confirming languages and top skills from both files for accuracy and avoiding redundancy.

**Analyzing LinkedIn Versus Summary**

I’m trying to figure out if I can delete 'linkedin\_profile.md' without losing important info. The LinkedIn profile includes unique details like top skills (e.g., Ollama), languages (German, English), a publication (GETESS), military service (FJB-40 Staff Sergeant), and specific experience with IoT projects. The summary.md includes most of these, such as languages (English), PyTorch (under frameworks), SQLite (under tools), but it doesn’t mention all the skills, military service, or the publication. So, these could be relevant to capture elsewhere if deleting LinkedIn.


Thought for 58 seconds


**Bottom-line**

You *can* delete **linkedin\_profile.md** once you copy a handful of items that are *only* present there. 98 % of the role history, dates, responsibilities, skills, certifications and education already live—often in richer form—in **summary.md**.  What would disappear (and how to preserve it) is detailed below.

### 1 . What exists **only** in `linkedin_profile.md`

| Category              | Unique information                                         | Where to store it before deletion                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Skills**            | *Ollama* (LLM runner) – not named anywhere else            | Add to the **Technologies / Frameworks** list or to your AI-tooling skills block in *summary.md*.                                                |
| **Languages**         | “German” (English already appears in summary)              | Add a one-line “Languages: English (native-level), German (native)” under “Leadership & Soft-Skills” (or create a dedicated Languages section).  |
| **Publication**       | *GETESS – Searching the Web Exploiting German Texts*       | Create a small **Publications** subsection (the project is referenced in the work-history but the actual paper is not).                          |
| **Early career**      | *FJB-40 – Staff Sergeant, 1978-1981* (military service)    | If you want a complete timeline, add a concise internship/early-career entry at the bottom of “Professional Experience”.                         |
| **Education**         | *Ostseegymnasium Rostock* (secondary diploma)              | Usually optional for senior CVs; capture under “Education – Earlier Studies” only if you value it.                                               |
| **Web links**         | zeromq.org (misc. “Other” link)                            | Decide if this link still serves a purpose; otherwise omit.                                                                                      |
| **Minor role colour** | A short bullet that you “spearheaded IoT projects” at EPAM | If IoT work is important, add a single bullet under the EPAM experience (“Architected several IoT proof-of-concepts for …”).                     |

### 2 . What’s already covered elsewhere

* Full role chronology from 1989 → 2025, including EPAM, Krungthai-AXA, Central Group, Agoda, S\&P, Bertelsmann, GECKO, etc., appears in **summary.md** with *far more detail*.&#x20;
* Certifications (TOGAF, Scrum Master, AWS SA-Associate, Machine Learning, Intro to Data Science) are duplicated.&#x20;
* Contact info, personal website, LinkedIn profile, and the high-level “Seasoned architect / AI evangelist” summary all exist—often word-for-word—in **summary.md**.&#x20;

### 3 . Recommended clean-up steps

1. **Add the unique items (table above) into summary.md** in the indicated sections.
2. Commit the change, verify your résumé generator / Pandoc workflow still renders correctly.
3. Remove **linkedin\_profile.md** from the repo.

After those small migrations you will lose no substantive information, and you will eliminate one redundant document.
