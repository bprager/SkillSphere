# my-job-agent

*A lightweight framework to curate, maintain, and publish my professional story*

---

## 1 · Purpose

This repo stores **a single source‑of‑truth** for everything that may show up in a résumé, cover letter, LinkedIn post, or project showcase.  The goal is to minimise duplication and make each downstream artefact (PDF résumé, web profile, etc.) a reproducible build from the same data.

## 2 · Key files

| File                         | Role                                                                                                       | Notes |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `summary.md`                 | **Canonical record** of work history, skills, education, certs and achievements. *Always edit this first.* |       |
| `README.md`                  | This guide.                                                                                                |       |
| `templates/ats_resume.latex` | Pandoc template for an ATS‑friendly PDF (US‑Letter).                                                       |       |
| `applications/<company>.md`  | Auto‑generated résumé drafts tailored to a job posting.                                                    |       |
| `scripts/`                   | Helper scripts (YAML → Markdown, linting, etc.).                                                           |       |

> **Deprecated**
> `linkedin_profile.md` duplicated almost all content from `summary.md`.  After moving the few unique items (Ollama skill, German language, GETESS publication, FJB‑40 service, early education) into *summary.md*, you can delete the file.

## 3 · Maintaining `summary.md`

* Structure mirrors the YAML you’ll use for prompt‑based résumé generation (**see §4**).
* Keep entries **chronological (newest first)** inside each section.
* Use concise, action‑oriented bullet points (max 2‑lines each).
* **Skills** → group by theme (e.g. `AI & ML`, `Cloud & DevOps`, `Leadership`).
* **Projects** → include impact metrics where possible (% cost saved, ↑ revenue, ↓ latency…).

## 4 · Generating a tailored résumé draft

Paste this prompt into ChatGPT (or the `scripts/gen_resume.sh` helper) and feed it a job description plus your current `summary.md`.  The model will output a **Markdown résumé** that *matches the YAML block below*.

```yaml
---
name: "<Full Name>"
title: "<Professional Title>"
email: "<Email>"
phone: "<Phone>"
location: "<City, Country>"
linkedin: "<LinkedIn URL>"
github: "<GitHub URL>"
website: "<Personal site>"
summary: |
  <2‑4 sentence value proposition>
skills:
  - category: "<Skill Category>"
    items: "<Comma‑separated skills>"
experience:
  - company: "<Company>"
    role: "<Title>"
    dates: "<Start – End>"
    location: "<City, Country>"
    bullets:
      - "<Achievement>"
projects:
  - name: "<Project>"
    description: "<One‑liner>"
education:
  - degree: "<Degree>"
    institution: "<School>"
    year: "<Year>"
certifications:
  - "<Certification>"
languages:
  - "English (fluent)"
  - "German (native)"
publications:
  - "GETESS – Searching the Web Exploiting German Texts"

```

### Prompt snippet

```text
You are an AI résumé generator.  Using the YAML schema above and the career data supplied, produce a Markdown résumé tuned to the attached job spec.  Focus on achievements that match the required skills.  Keep bullet points to max 20 words.
```

## 5 · Building the PDF

```bash
pandoc applications/<company>.md \
      -o applications/Resume_<company>.pdf \
      --template=templates/ats_resume.latex \
      --pdf-engine=xelatex   # or lualatex
```

* `ats_resume.latex` is configured for **US‑Letter**, Helvetica font, 1" margins.
* The template automatically hides empty sections (e.g., no Projects → no heading).

## 6 · Workflow checklist (TL;DR)

1. **Update `summary.md`** whenever you finish a project, earn a cert, or need to add unique info.
2. Run `scripts/check_duplication.py` (optional) to flag potential overlap or missing fields.
3. Generate a role‑specific Markdown résumé (see §4).
4. Compile to PDF with Pandoc (see §5).
5. Commit artefacts (`summary.md`, new PDF) – but never commit autogenerated Markdown drafts.
